This below is a basic backend for CRUD operations on MONGO DB, It was originally made to test API building and get a hands-on-experience on the api testing tools like insomnia, It currently performs all functions such as 

get
put
update
create
delete

on a basic Product model, that takes name, price and quantity as data in json. It was important to me as I was unaware of the HTTP methods, and was always confused while following a backend tutorial. 

i enjoyed this project.

hehe....
